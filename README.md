# 'Detection of Automatic Girl Child Trafficking'

Girl child trafficking has become a matter of serious concern for human society. There are different manual approaches
to stop and prevent it. In this work, we proposed a two-stage computational model for automatic girl child trafficking by analyzing
images. Due to the unavailability of girl child trafficking images, we constructed a data set having one thousand four hundred ninety-six
data. Three features - age, emotion, and gender were considered for the development of the proposed computational model. In the
first stage, ResNet 50 deep neural network was used to determine the three feature values from an image. In the next level, a Support
Vector Machine (SVM) was used to determine whether there is a possibility of girl child trafficking or not. It has been observed that
the proposed model can detect girl child trafficking with an accuracy of 93.13%. The high accuracy observed in the study indicates the
candidature of the proposed model for real-time child trafficking.
